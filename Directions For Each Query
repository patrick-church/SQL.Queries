1. Get a list of all restaurants (by camis) who have been cited for a violation containing the words 'vermin', 'mice', or 'rats'.
Have your query return the following columns:
- camis
- dba
- viol_id
- viol_desc
- A count of the number of times they have been cited for each violation

Order the results with the most violations on top.


2. For each different cuisine type, determine the most commonly cited violation excluding viol_id 10F (this is by far the most common violation, and not very "gross").
Have your query return:
- cuisine
- viol_id
- viol_desc
- Number of violations for their most common violation (except 10F)

Limit those results to cuisine types where the max number of violations is greater than 1000.
Order the results in ascending order by the cuisine type.


3. When the action description contains the word 'closed', what are the top 5 associated violations?
Have your query return:
- action_desc
- viol_desc
- total number of violations

Order the results with the largest number of violations on top


4. Determine which restaurant has been closed the most (action description contains 'closed').
For that camis, have your query return:
- camis
- dba
- viol_desc
- total number of violations per violation type

Include all violations for that camis (not just the ones they were closed for)
Order the results with the most common violation on top



5. Group all restaurants by their DBA, and computer the average number of violations per location.
For example, if there were 100 restaurants with the dba "STARBUCKS", and they had a total of 123 violations, then the average number of violations per location would be 123/100=1.23.
Have your query return:
- dba
- Number of locations
- Number of violations
- Avg violations per location

Order the results with the largest number of locations on top


6. For restaurants (by DBA) with only a single location (i.e., DBA with exactly 1 associated CAMIS) and more than 10 total violations, what is their top violation, and how many times have they been cited for it?
Note that a restaurant might have been cited 1 time each for 10 different types of violations, and 2 times for another violation. That would be 12 total violations, which counts as more than 10.

Limit your results to cases where their top violation occurred greater than or equal to 15 times.
Have your query return:
- camis
- dba
- viol_desc
- number of violations

Order your results by number of violations, descending.


7. Considering all possible combinations of violation/action, how many of those combinations do not occur in the data?
Have your query return just the total number.



8. Return the action and violation descriptions associated with the previous question.
Have your query return:
- action_desc
- viol_desc

Order your results in ascending order by viol_desc



9. For all restaurants (by camis) that have been cited for 90 or more violations, what is their top violation?
Have your query return:
- camis
- dba
- viol_id
- viol_desc
- Number of violations (for the top violation only)

Order the results in ascending order by dba
